This is the title!

# And this is a H1-Header

Some text underneath, *this is italics*.
This is another line, **but using bold**.
~~This would be strikethrough~~.

## Now a H2-Header

Some more text.

Now let's do lists:

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item
  * with an unordered sub-item
  * and another one
5. Fifth item
  5.1. with an ordered sub-item
  5.2. and another one
6. Sixth and last

Unordered list:
* can use asterisks
- or minuses
+ or pluses

### Now a H3-Header

I want to use a divider now

And this is some code:

```bash
var="Hello World"
echo $var
```

Now I'll try embedding an image:
